# The grant fund is currently closed as funds are limited.
Thanks to our sponsors we run a grant fund. The fund is topped up every January after the main UKGovCamp event.

Have a look at events we’ve already supported for inspiration.

To apply, your event must:
- help make public services or citizen engagement better,
- build a public facing presence and ticketing,
- usually be free for participants,
- be not-for-profit.

Applications are posted in the #grant-fund channel of our Slack (which you can join at the bottom of our home page).

People then have 1 week to comment, 👍 approve or 👎 reject your application.

Please note that you cannot vote for your own application.

Our treasurer has a casting vote in case of a tie.

If applications are successful we:

- publish it as a supported event,
- send payment and branding details,
- require unspent funds to be returned.

Email grants@ukgovcamp.com if you have questions.
