# UKGovCamp Code of Conduct

**Need to report an incident? Approach an organiser.**

We (the organisers of UKGovCamp) believe that our online spaces, just like our
physical spaces, should be free from harassment, bullying and hate.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, neurotype, physical appearance, age, race, ethnicity, nationality,
socio-economic status, language, religion or any other characteristic.

Everyone who participates at UKGovCamp has a responsibility to help us create a
safe online space and must agree to our code of conduct. This includes all
attendees, organisers, volunteers (referred to as ‘Campmakers’) and sponsors.

## Unacceptable behaviour includes (but is not limited to):

* offensive verbal comments
* deliberate intimidation, bullying, harassment
* stalking and/or following
* violence and/or threats of violence
* unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact
* sharing content/links to content which is illegal, pornographic or other
  inappropriate material
* sustained disruption of talks/sessions
* other behaviour deemed inappropriate, offensive, threatening or harmful.
* unsolicited and/or persistent messaging in private channels (e.g. twitter
  direct messages)
* instigating or encouraging any of the behaviours set out above is also
  unacceptable

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the
organisers will take action they deem appropriate, including (but not limited
to) removing the participant from UKGovCamp and banning them from future events.

Organisers will drop into sessions throughout the week to check for any
inappropriate behaviour, and we have asked our Campmakers to do the same.

## Photography and recording

You are welcome to take pictures and record audio and video at the event, so
long as it does not include attendees wearing special lanyards (usually red or
orange in colour).

Please do not record sessions.

## How to report an incident:

If you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behaviour as outlined above,
please approach an organiser.

Please also tell us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in
distress, or violations of these guidelines; even if the situation is not
happening to you. We are here to help.

## Thank you
