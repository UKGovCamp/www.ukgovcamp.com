# Become a sponsor

UKGovCamp works because of our awesome sponsors.

Year after year they help us grow and become more inclusive.

After last year’s bumper edition, this year we will be going back to our roots
with a 200 person event at MoJ, focussing on our community and making the event
as enjoyable, equitable and engaging as possible.

Thank you (-:
