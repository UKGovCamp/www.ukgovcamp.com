# Become a sponsor

UKGovCamp happens because of our awesome sponsors.

Year after year they help us become more inclusive.

Thank you ðŸ™‚

## Rules

All organisations and individuals can apply to sponsor us, so long as you follow
our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

**We value:**

- discussion over sales pitches,
- inclusion over non-compete agreements,
- attendee privacy over sharing personal data.

## Sponsorship levels

### Platinum Â£3000
