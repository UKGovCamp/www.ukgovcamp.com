# Privacy Policy

We’re an independent organisation that’s run events since 2007.

Our community’s at the heart of what we do, and we’ll continue to protect data you entrust to us.

This policy explains how we use your personal data.

## What data we collect

- Attendee information (name, email address, social media addresses, gender, ethnicity, age, any requirements for health or caring responsibilities)
- Sponsor information (organisation name, contact name, email address, phone number, amount sponsored)

## How we collect your data

Via registration and sponsorship forms.

## How we use your data

- Attendee information is used to understand your needs, tailor the event and contact you to provide tickets
- Aggregate data is used to monitor our allocation mechanism, eg for diversity
- Sponsor information is used to contact you before and after the event to discuss present and future sponsorships

We collect attendee data to help make UKGovCamp as inclusive as possible, especially if we’re unable to reach particular demographics.

**We will not share your data with any third parties under any circumstances.**

Only our organisers have access to this data.

A list of organisers can be found on our website.

## How we store your data

We securely store your data in the cloud using Google Workspace tools, ie Docs, Sheets, Forms, etc.

As per Article 5 (e) of the GDPR, we only keep your data for as long as we need to process it. In practice this means that:

- attendee data is kept after the event so we can ensure the safety of attendees from year to year, and work so that ticketing is fair.
- sponsorship information is kept after the event so we can contact them again in future.

## Marketing

UKGovCamp will never send you any marketing materials.

## Your data protection rights

Providing us with your personal data gives you the right to:

- access a copy of it
- rectify anything that’s inaccurate and put it right
- erase it
- restrict processing
- object to processing, though this removes your ability to be chosen to attend
- portability, ie transfer it to another organisation, or directly to youself.

We’ll respond to any request you make to organisers@ukgovcamp.com within 1 month.
