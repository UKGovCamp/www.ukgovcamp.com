    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Since 2007, <a href="/about">UKGovCamp</a> has been a welcoming and inclusive annual event to enable people working in or with the public sector to come together and try to make things better. It is free, run entirely by volunteers and funded by <a href="/sponsors">sponsors</a>. Unconference topics are set by attendees on the day, and discuss things which are important to them, in the hope of achieving better outcomes for users of public services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The magic of the day comes from the serendipity created by bringing people who work in different areas of the public sector together so they can talk as equals, irrespective of grade or role. Everyone's experiences and input are important, and this open, informal and relaxed forum is what makes the event special.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every previous UKGovCamp has taken place in London, but this year we want to break it out. With its legacy of digital innovation and role as a central and local government hub, Birmingham was chosen as best fit for this experiment. This presents an opportunity for new attendees from the region and beyond to benefit from attending a UKGovCamp and seeing what a vibrant city Birmingham is.

    <h2>Sponsors</h2>
    <p>
        UKGovCamp would not be possible without our <a href="/sponsors">sponsors</a>; they help us make accessible, memorable events, keep them free to attend and provide catering, creché, bursaries and more. We are not-for-profit; and any funds left over from running costs go into our <a href="/grants">grant fund</a> to help the GovCamp community run other valuable events throughout the year.

        Since 2019, UKGovCamp has supported the <a href="https://treesforlife.org.uk/">Trees for Life</a> initiative. Trees in our grove will be carefully planted in protected sites in the Scottish Highlands where they will create homes for wildlife and forests for the future. If you’d like to plant a tree or make a donation, please <a href="https://treesforlife.org.uk/groves/96110/">visit our grove</a>.
