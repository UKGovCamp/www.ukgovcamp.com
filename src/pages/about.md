# About UK Gov Camp

## UK Gov Camp is

* free to attend,
* led by attendees,
* run by volunteers.

## Attendees lead by:

* suggesting discussion topics,
* merging similar topics together,
* adding topics to the [session grid](https://j.mp/ukgovcamp).

## Then we discuss:

* each topic on the session grid,
* how it makes people feel,
* what we'll do next.
