# About us

100 of us first met in 2008 at Google's Victoria office. We [discussed everything](http://barcamp.org/w/page/401732/BarcampUKGovweb) from e-voting, to the politics of FOI and vitual worlds. 

We've met [every year since](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6nemSPxSLrURGigaQZFKViWBoAhalpE2f0RtZ92Fpk/edit?gid=13#gid=13) and now average 250 people per event, though are always over subscribed. 



## UK Gov Camp is

* free to attend,
* led by attendees,
* run by volunteers.

## Attendees lead by:

* suggesting discussion topics,
* merging similar topics together,
* adding topics to the [session grid](https://j.mp/ukgovcamp).

## Then we discuss:

* each topic on the session grid,
* how it makes people feel,
* what we'll do next.
