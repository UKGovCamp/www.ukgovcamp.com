# About UK Gov Camp

## UK GovCamp is

- free to attend,
- led by attendees,
- run by volunteers.

## Attendees lead by:

- suggesting discussion topics,
- merging similar topics together,
- adding topics to the session grid.

## Then we discuss:

- each topic on the session grid,
- how it makes people feel,
- what we'll do next.
