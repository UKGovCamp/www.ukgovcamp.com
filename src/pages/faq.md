## The event

### How does unconference work? I am not familiar with it.

Unconferences are participant-driven events, where the agenda is created by the
attendees on the day, instead of being pre-set by organisers.

### What do I need to bring on the day?

Please bring photo ID for registration. You must have a ticket in your name to
enter the event. You don’t need to print your ticket, just bring photo ID (a
government pass is fine).

### Where can I find an agenda for the day?

Once built, the agenda will be hosted on a physical board at the event. We will
also publish it online for attendees.

### Do I need to bring a laptop?

We try to keep conversations digital-free. However, you are free to do so.

### Are there quiet spaces available?

Yes, we have a quiet room and a prayer room.

### Will there be lunch, drinks and snacks provided throughout the day?

There will be light meals and drinks at the event.
