# What should I expect from the day?

**Location:**
[Birmingham City Council House, Victoria Square, Birmingham B1 1B](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/directory_record/3599/council_house)

**Date:** Saturday 17th January 2026

**Time**: 10:00 - 16:30

A day of discussions (not presentations). So come with ideas to discuss,
questions to answer and interactive workshops you’d like to run (not slide
decks).

The event is an [Unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference).
After an initial welcome, attendees are invited to come forward with a ‘pitch’
about a topic they want to discuss. A brief show of hands is taken to consider
space and room sizes, and the topic is added to a session grid, which is built
in real time. In this way, attendees set the agenda for the day and can choose
how to spend their time most valuably. There is often a focus on digital and
data topics, but pitches are always wide ranging and engaging.

We strongly encourage movement between sessions, even when they’re running. We
call this the law of mobility and it helps spread ideas between sessions.

Sessions last around 45 minutes, with time for swapping and changing rooms in
between, and an hour is put aside for lunch, which is also covered by the event.
Everyone then comes together at the end of the day for summing up, thank yours
and goodbyes. Conversations usually carry on into social time and soft drinks
will be provided at the venue, which is open until 18:00.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

documents. But you’re welcome to add your own notes to the docs, either on the
day or afterwards.

better.
