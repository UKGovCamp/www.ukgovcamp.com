As part of the launch of #UKGC26, we are improving our digital presence and
making it more sustainable going forward.

The first part of this is the launch of a new website. We have moved away from
WordPress, this website was built with Astro, hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
[Check out the source code if you want to know more](https://github.com/UKGovCamp/www.ukgovcamp.com).

Some things may not be as they were, especially content that was migrated from
WordPress. If you find anything that you think definitely needs fixing, let us
know.

This is only the first step, more will come as we approach #UKGC26, so stay
tuned and watch this space!
