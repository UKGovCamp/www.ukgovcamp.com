Registration for UKGovCamp 2026 (#ukgc26) closed at 4pm Wednesday 29 October 2025. \
\
Tickets will be issued next week in early November. \
\
We won't be running a lottery this year, so everyone who applied will get a ticket. 

If you registered, but don't receive a ticket by the end of next week (Friday 7 November 2025) then it's likely you gave us the wrong email address or you've changed email address since you registered. 

Please don't contact us until Friday 7 November 2025 with queries about tickets. UKGovCamp is run by volunteers who all have busy day jobs.
