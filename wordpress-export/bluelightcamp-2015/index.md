A two day event for Emergency Services and those working in and around them. We run an unconference on day one and a hackathon on day two. This is run as a non-profit and we offer the event on a free basis to the attendees. We will be seeking funding from other sponsors also in relation to running the event but this would cover the food and drink – we have a venue sorted already as West Midlands Fire Service are hosting.
