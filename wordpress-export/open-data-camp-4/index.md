- **Applicant:** Mark Braggins
- **Funding agree:** £500

**Event details:** A weekend unconference for anyone interested in open data. The event is free to attend, with costs covered by sponsorship

**Funding will be used for:** Helping to cover the costs of running the event. A lot of effort goes into capturing conversations and other content which is produced over the weekend so that there is a record which can be shared with the largest possible audience. Costs include venue staffing, live-drawing, stationery, and refreshments for attendee

**About the organiser:** Mark helps organisations and people connect with each other. He's witnessed many "light bulb moments" associated with unconferences, and is particularly fascinated when there's a mash-up of people with a range of different backgrounds and perspectives sharing ideas about how open data can be used in different ways (and for the greater good)
