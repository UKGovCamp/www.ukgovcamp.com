Event description: We want to run Librarycamp 2013. It’s an unconference for up to 250 people.  It’s a free event and open to anyone interested in public libraries and this year we are trying hard to attract more public library staff, customers and people from other sectors like housing and social care (rather than academic librarians). Sessions are pitched on the day and we encourage attendees to try different formats, workshops and discussions rather than traditional presentations. We want lots of discussion plus ACTION (hopefully) around the theme of innovation, user experience, community involvement and transformation in public libraries and the way we think about public libraries. We have two provisional dates either the last Saturday in September of Sat 30 November 2013.
