## Thank you to our sponsors

UKGovCamp is supported by [sponsors](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/sponsors/)**.** They keep the event free to attend, provide catering, crechÃ©, bursaries and more. Leftover funds go into our [grant fund](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/grants/) to support similar events.

## What (not) to expect

A day of discussions (not presentations). So come with ideas to discuss, questions to answer and interactive workshops youâ€™d like to run (not slidedecks).Â 

At the start of the event weâ€™ll create the agenda together. Anyone can stand up and pitch a session (or a volunteer can do it for you). Topics are then added to the [session grid](https://j.mp/ukgovcamp).Â 

Sessions are 45 minutes long, with a minimum 15 minute break between each. Thereâ€™s 2 sessions before lunch and 3 afterwards. There'll be at least 8 dedicated rooms, giving a potential 40 sessions throughout the day.Â 

We strongly encourage you to move between sessions, even when theyâ€™re running. We call this the law of mobility and it helps spread ideas between sessions.Â

## Catering

The onsite cafe provides a free lunch at 12:45 and 2 barista made hot drinks whenever you want. Please bring a reusable cup if you have one. The onsite cafe covers most dietary needs youâ€™ve told us about. Where we canâ€™t, weâ€™ll order from [Pret a Manger](https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB/hk-allergen-guide).Â 

Thereâ€™s also a DIY drinks station downstairs, with a selection of teas and cordials. Please bring your own water bottle / flask. We have a limited number of paper cups.Â 

## CrÃ¨che

We have a few spaces left in the creche. Email [organisers+creche@ukgovcamp.com](mailto:organisers+creche@ukgovcamp.com) to book.Â 

- CrÃ¨che opens at 0900 and closes at 1700
- You must bring a pack lunch for your child(ren)Â 
- Please bring warm/outdoor clothes for your child (if you give consent for creche staff to take them for a walk in the park, weather permitting)

## Social media

The hashtag is #ukgc25 (which is short for UKGovCamp 2025). Please use it in everything you share publicly.Â 

You can also tag the UKGovCamp social media accounts on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ukgovcamp.bsky.social), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ukgovcamp), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.me.uk/@ukgovcamp) and [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/UKGovCamp). Thereâ€™s also a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3758314/) you can post in.Â 

In the unlikely event that the main #ukgc25 hashtag gets spammed, you can specify a particular session using #ukgc25 +s\_ (for the session number) +r\_ (for the room number). So the hashtag for Session 1, Room 1 = #ukgc25s1r1

## Session notes

Each session has its own collaborative document that anyone can edit. You can access the docs via the session grid at [bit.ly/ukgovcamp](http://bit.ly/ukgovcamp).

Each session will have a couple of volunteers to add names and notes to the documents. But youâ€™re welcome to add your own notes to the docs, either on the day or afterwards.

## Photographs and videos

We encourage you to take photographs and videos to share publicly, except of anyone whoâ€™s wearing a yellow lanyard. They have requested not to have their likeness shared.

## Swapshop

Outside conference room 1 is the swapshop. If you have stickers, books or anything else (within reason) youâ€™d like to donate to the swapshop, please bring it with you.Â 

## Prayer room

A prayer room is available. Please ask a volunteer for access.

## Quiet roomÂ 

Conference room 10 is the designated quiet room. Theyâ€™ll be colouring books or similar to help you unwind in silence. Please do not speak or take calls in this room.

## Parents room

Conference room 11 is for breastfeeding or private moments with your children.Â 

## Friday / Saturday night socials

Weâ€™re still securing a venue near MOJ and will update this page and email everyone when we know. Weâ€™re trying to avoid bars and pubs this year, so let us know if you have somewhere in mind. Both the Friday and Saturday night socials start at 5pm.

## Sunday and beyond

Once youâ€™ve recovered, please do dip into the session notes via [bit.ly/ukgovcamp](http://bit.ly/ukgovcamp) and share your blog posts via the #ukgc25 hashtag. Your thoughts will help make the public sector better.
