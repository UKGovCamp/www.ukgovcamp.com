**About you, what you do, and your interest in running this event**: I‚Äôm a visionary ideator and a passionate advocate for innovation in young minds. I am deeply invested in fostering creativity and leadership skills among young people. I work as investment policy and programme manager with MHCLG. Additionally, through my volunteer role in Civil Service Design thinking community. I have seen first-hand how structured ideation can empower individuals to solve real-work challenges.

A study found that 94% of young people want to be involved in decision-making, with their well-being, environmental concerns, and sense of community being their top priorities, Inspired by this, I launched a Mini Ideathon earlier this year in a primary school in Kent, where children generated creative solutions to local issues -such as walking ambassadors for safer school walks and sensor-based recycling systems. The event was well received, with teachers highlighting how it aligns with the PHSE curriculum. Building on this success, we now want to bring the Mini Ideathon to London to reach more children, empowering them to be problem solvers in their communities.
