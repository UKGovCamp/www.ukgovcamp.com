For more than a decade GovCamp has been the UK's premier unconference for government and government-adjacent folks. During that time we've been what's known as an unincorporated association -Â "an organisation set up through an agreement between a group of people who come together for a reason other than to make a profit" but without any formal legal structure.

We've recently decided that we need to put GovCamp on a more formal legal footing. There are a number of reasons for this.

- Some other organisations will only do business with groups that have a formal legal structure.
- We've been involved in increasing amounts of grant giving which would be better coming from a formal organisation.
- Moving away from personal responsibility!

There are lots of options for next steps. We could become a Community Interest Company, a non-profit company or one of more many possible alternatives.

We're looking for suggestions of solicitors or equivalent organisations that can offer us an, ideally free, initial consultation and which we can then subsequently pay to do the related paperwork for the new formal organisation.

If you have any recommendations for us please let us know at organisers@ukgovcamp.com.

Thanks!
