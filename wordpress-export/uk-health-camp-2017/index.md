Below is the text of a successful grant application.

**Description**: UK Health Camp is a free unconference for everyone interested in digital, design, technology and data for health and care. You can find information on our website: [http://ukhealthcamp.com/](http://ukhealthcamp.com/)

We ran successfully in 2015, this will be our second run. We expect around 150 attendees.

We are taking huge inspiration from GovCamp. In this context, inspiration means ~stealing~ borrowing the format, sponsorship and marketing copy, and many other ideas.

**How much they want**: £1,000 or as near an offer as you feel appropriate...

**What they would use the funding for**: We’ve raised £3,500 in sponsorship commitments so far, our total event budget is around £8,000. That goes on venue, lunch, coffee, photography, t-shirts and some change on stationary / stickers / emergencies etc. We have spreadsheets if you’re into details.

**About them**: The event is run by volunteers who work in or around the health system and want to make it better.
