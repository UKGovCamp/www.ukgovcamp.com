Hello folks,

With summer a distant memory and the colours of Autumn beginning to flourish it's that time of year again when we start gearing up for UKGovcamp. UKGovcamp 2019 will be held on the 19th of January in Central London.

Like previous Govcamps, we are holding a ticket lottery - have a read of last years [lottery](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/2017/11/10/ukgovcamp-2018-ticket-lottery/)  to see what happened.

[![](images/Vc3v_Vgh_400x400.jpg)](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Vc3v_Vgh_400x400.jpg)This year we are also asking for your help. Earlier on this year, our dear friend [David Pearson](https://teacamplondon.com/2018/09/04/in-memory-of-david-september-teacamp-cancelled/), a huge supporter of UKGovcamp passed away.

He volunteered his time to UKGovcamp and many other unconferences, taking memorable pictures and documenting our shared digital history.

We'd like to honour him, with creating an award for "outstanding content", in remembering his work as web content manager at Defra.  If you'd like to help us in doing this, please let us know on your lottery ticket entry.

If you'd like a chance of attending UKGovcamp 2019 please fill out your details in the [UKGovcamp 2019 lottery entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-a5xotUKU8YKHDJPdDtPc3b7pjicwtbo4Rh608XWLDoIp4Q/viewform).

The lottery closes at 23:59pm on the 1st of November.

Good luck!
