An unconference for people working with older citizens to help them live fulfilling, connected, and healthy lives. It will be open to everyone wanting to work with others to improve the support given to older people, particularly, but not exclusively, where they are seeking to introduce social and mobile technologies into their work. It will focus on helping those who are struggling to incorporate new and different ways of working into their work.
