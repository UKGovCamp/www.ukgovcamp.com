**Description of the event:** First Environment Agency Mental Health Unconference following on from a related Civil Service conference. We’ll have space for 100 to share, listen, learn, try new things to help build resilience, make pledges, share resilience ideas

**How much funding?** £500

**What will it be used for?** I would like to put on a yoga session, hire a smoothie bike, get some badges about mental health for attendees and if possible cater so that people can continue the conversations over lunch

**Details of the applicant:** [Paul Wyse](https://twitter.com/wiggazzz), Engagement manager in Flood at the Environment Agency. I’m a depressed, anxiety sufferer, passionate mental health campaigner, who believes in getting on with it to make things change
