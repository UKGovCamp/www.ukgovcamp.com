A bursary is a non-repayable monetary award to help you attend UKGovCamp 2025.

It is normally used to pay for attendee's travel and accomodation, though other requests will be considered.

## Criteria

You can apply for a bursary if:

1. you have a ticket to UKGovCamp 2025,
2. your employer won't pay your expenses,
3. you cannot attend without our support.

## How much you can apply for

The maximum help we normally provide is Â£200 per person, though happy to consider other requests.

## Timings on the day

To help you get prices for travel and accomodation, please remember that on the day:

- the event doesn't start until 10am,
- the [first session](https://j.mp/ukgovcamp) starts at 11am,
- we finish at 5pm.

## Accomodation

If you need accomodation please remember:

- to check [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/?Input=&lineIds=&dateTypeSelect=Future%20date&direction=&startDate=2025-01-18T00%3a00%3a00&endDate=2025-01-18T23%3a59%3a59#line-lul-jubilee) for closures,
- to [check airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/London--United-Kingdom/homes?monthly_start_date=2025-01-01&monthly_length=3&monthly_end_date=2025-04-01&query=Londo&checkin=2025-01-17&checkout=2025-01-19&adults=1) or similar, as well as local hotels,
- the further from Westminster you stay, the cheaper it gets.

1. Make sure you meet the criteria listed above,
2. get quotes for your travel and/or accomodation,
3. email a summary to [organisers+bursary@ukgovcamp.com](mailto:organisers+bursary@ukgovcamp.com).
