Below is the exact text of a recently approved grant application.

**Proposed event**: SilentGovCamp.

**Description of the proposed Event**: A silent govcamp. The purpose and format are, themselves, a bit of an experiment. To see if we can engage/enable different people to take part in discussions around the future of government and public services if they don't have to talk.

I wrote about this idea at [https://medium.com/benproctor-co-uk/sshh-would-you-come-to-a-silent-govcamp-3d321595ec82](https://medium.com/benproctor-co-uk/sshh-would-you-come-to-a-silent-govcamp-3d321595ec82)

**How much they want**: Â£150.

**What they would use the funding for**: Venue hire (I imagine this will be a half-day event).

**About them**: I'm [Ben Proctor](https://twitter.com/likeaword). I work at [The Satori lab](https://twitter.com/thesatorilab) now. I want to make government (especially local government) work better. I've been involved in a few govcamps over the years and I have a background in stakeholder dialogue so I'm particularly interested in what enables and prevents people from collaborating and discussing issues.
