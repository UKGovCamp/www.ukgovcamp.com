For my NHS Change Day pledge I said I would try to bring some of what I know from other sectors into the NHS. One of these things is my experience of unconferences and open learning event. I plan to hold an event in the summer in Manchester for people who work in communications and have an interest in the NHS and healthcare. Digital and traditional.
