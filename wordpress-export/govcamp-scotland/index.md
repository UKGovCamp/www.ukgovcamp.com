**Event details:**

We're back for 2017! GovCamp Scotland will follow the format, purpose and intended audiences as our mother UKGovCamp events. We'd like to do a little better this year at casting our net much wider than previous years though getting folk from different sectors (namely third, tech, creative and academic) and diversifying the audience are priorities. We're also focussed on building up a stronger online community that is sustained better than it has been in the past.

**Funding will be used for:** 

We'd like to use the funding to pay for refreshed logo design, buying a .scot domain and kick off hosting subscription. Getting new web assets sorted is the first step before raising awareness and finding more funding.

**About the organiser:** 

I'm a long time public service agitator with an interest in exploring social good enabled by digital things. I defected from work in government late last year and I'm now doing freelance work with charities, local SMEs (namely tech) and government bodies to help them build digital capability and connect with others outside their sectors and disciplines. I am interested in running this event because I have been handed the baton from Lesley Thomson (previous organiser) and I finally have time to focus on putting together a kick ass GovCamp Scotland for 2017. I'm also now better connected with creative and tech industries than I ever have been and I'd like to act as a connector to bring people together who otherwise might never reasonably meet.
