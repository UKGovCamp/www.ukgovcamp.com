DeliverCon have successfully applied to the UKGovCamp grant fund and will receive £750. Below is their application:

**Name of applicant:** James Cattell

**Description of the event:** DeliverCon is an unconference for the public sector delivery management community. We welcome anyone who works in or with the public sector, including suppliers. We run it just like UKGovCamp, with the additon of lightning talks over lunch. It's purpose is for attendees to share experiences and knowledge, all in a relatively safe space.

**How much funding are you looking for?** £750.

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?** Lunch for attendees

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:** I'm a community and delivery manager working in or with the Civil Service. I've been involved with DeliverCon since it's inception in 2018. This is 1 of the few events explictly for public sector delivery managers, so I'm keen to see it repeated this year.
