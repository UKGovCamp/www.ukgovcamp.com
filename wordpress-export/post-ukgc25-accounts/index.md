The annual UK Gov Camp 2025 (ukgc25) unconference on Saturday 18 January 2025 was a great success. Thank you to everyone who supported us and/or came to the event.

 

Income was £17,500.00 and expenses £14,800.70, which breaks down as:

- +£17,500 sponsorship
- \-£4,500 catering (aprox)
- \-£4,262 creche
- \-£2,800 post event drinks and food
- \-£1,263.11 [bursaries](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/2024/12/19/ukgc25-bursary/)
- \-£729.76 organiser's expenses
- \-£647.39 organiser's hoodies
- \-£598.44 other expenses

Notes:

- The £4,500 catering hasn't been invoiced to us yet, hence being labelled as "approx" (though it's likely to be less than that).
- Organisers volunteer their time for free, with some of us claiming for travel and accomodation, and the hoodies being a special thank you gift.
- "Other expenses" include audio / visual equipment, venue security, consumables and things for the DIY drinks station.

 

The current bank balance is £18,667.85.

If we subtact:

- £4,850 in current grant fund requests,
- £4,500 in unpaid ukgc25 catering costs,
- £5,000 of Open Data Camp's money we hold.

 

**That leaves £4,317.85 for rest of the year.**
