**Description of the event:** GovCamp Cymru 2019 is a gathering of people who want to improve public services in Wales. The event will be held on the 20th September 2019 @ the Pierhead Building in Cardiff Bay. It uses the unconference format, where the attendees lead the programme. The event is free to attend and open to anyone who wants to be there: public/private/whatever sector, for work or if they’re just passionate about public services in Wales, and how they affect our lives.

**How much funding are you looking for?** £500

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?** The grant will contribute towards a wide range of things e.g. venue logistics, lunch and refreshments, material costs etc. that sort of thing.

**Tell us a bit about yourself:** I'm Luke, a business analyst at [The Satori Lab](https://thesatorilab.com/). I recently joined the organisation and have since been thrust into the hot seat to lead the GovCamp Cymru event for 2019. There is a growing appetite for improving public services across Wales and so our aim for GCC19 is to harness it and help it to flourish.
