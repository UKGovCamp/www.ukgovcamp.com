Howdy UKGovcampers,

Last week we published our [Gender & Diversity stats from the ticket lottery,](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/2017/11/10/ukgovcamp-2018-ticket-lottery/) and have also created the [UKGovcamp 2018 ticket lottery applicant Twitter List for you to follow.](https://twitter.com/UKGovCamp/lists/ukgc18-lotteryapplicants/members)

This years UKGovcamp 2018 will be held on the 20th of January, from 9am to 5pm at the [Ministry of Justice](https://goo.gl/maps/iZjirR2ctH52). So get it bookmarked in your calendars!

## Unclaimed Tickets

After that, any **unclaimed tickets** will be given to the next set of lottery winners etc etc until all tickets have been allocated.

Because of such high demand for tickets,  we held a lottery to try and be as fair and impartial as possible. Nearly 600 people applied for just 200 places. In previous years we have had a high drop out rate on the day, which has denied a place that could have gone to someone else.

We understand that life happens, so please let us know as much as you can in advance if your aren't going to make it. That way we can reallocate your ticket to the next person in line from the lottery.

If you don't cancel and don't turn up you'll be **added to our strike-out list which means tickets won't be available to you for the next event**.

Team [@UKGovcamp](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/about/) look forward to seeing you all at [#ukgc18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ukgc18?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag)
