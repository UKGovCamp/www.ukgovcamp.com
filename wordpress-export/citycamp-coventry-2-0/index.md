CityCamp Coventry 2.0 – can you help improve Coventry’s health?

Volunteers are needed to take part in an event that will come up with ideas to improve the health and wellbeing of the people of Coventry.

CityCamp 2014 is a competition-style event where local people can pitch ideas to make a positive difference to the health of the city.

It is taking place on Friday 17 and Saturday 18 January, in the Council House and will look to come up with sustainable ideas from the community on how local people can help to improve Coventry’s health and wellbeing.

The ideas could build upon existing community-led initiatives; or they could use your own assets, knowledge and skills.

The event is community-led, but the best ideas will attract help and support from the Council and local partners – including Coventry University and DWP – to turn their ideas into reality.

Ideas can be submitted on the website this month and a number will then be selected for people and organisations to “pitch” at the start of the two day event in front of other participants. During CityCamp these will be firmed up with the help of voluntary organisations and participants representing all walks of life will contribute.

There will be further opportunities to pitch ideas as they develop and towards the end of the event, the most developed ideas will be invited to give a five minute presentation to a panel of judges, with one winning idea about Public Health and one winning idea about Welfare Reform being chosen.
