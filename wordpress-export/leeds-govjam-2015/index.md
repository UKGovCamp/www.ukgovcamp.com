Sister event to Leeds Service Jam, already supported by a GovCamp Grant, and part of the Global GovJam 2015.

GovJam is a global event which applies tools and techniques of service design to the world of government and the public sector. Working around a common theme, small teams meet at multiple locations, working for 48 hours to prototype innovative approaches to challenges faced by the public sector. At the end of the two days, they upload their results and publish them for the world under a creative commons license.

It’s for anyone and everyone with an interest in public services and making them better. Leeds GovJam brings together people working in local authorities, the NHS, national government departments, as well as the private and voluntary sectors. What they all have in common is a curiosity to try new ways of working together around public sector opportunities and issues.
