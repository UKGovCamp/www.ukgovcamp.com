**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:** I used to work in local government but I've been freelance for six years. I first started to run unconferences in 2010 and started commscamp in 2013. We're trying something new in 2020 and I'm happy to share the insight for other potential online unconference organisers.
