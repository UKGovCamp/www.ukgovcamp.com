BarCampLondon have successfully applied for a grant to support their event. Here are details of the application:

**Your full name**

Terence Eden

**Name of your event**

BarCampLondon 13

**Description of the event**

Longest running London BarCamp. Unconference for anyone - not just focused on tech. Happening in London on November 23rd. Expecting around 125 attendees based on last year and this year's ticket sales.

**How much funding do you need?**

£750

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?**

Catering costs (especially allergy-compliant meals). Thank you gifts for speakers, activities for children (we don't have a crèche but people bring their kids and they often need separate activities). Transport bursaries for those who want to attend (event tickets are free). Facilities (flip charts, Sharpies, Post it notes, lanyards, etc),

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:**

I've helped run BarCampLondon for a few years. I'm a regular attendee of unconferences. I also run community hackathons.
