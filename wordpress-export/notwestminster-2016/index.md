Notwestminster is for everyone who has something positive to say about local democracy – and for anyone who is up for a challenge. We’re asking participants to change one small thing (or lots of small things) to make local democracy work better for all of us. On Friday 12th & Saturday 13th February 2016 we are bringing people together to debate and respond to our Design Challenges for Local Democracy. The challenges have all been contributed by participants in our network, following our first event (which was in February 2015, kindly supported by a GovCamp Grant). We’re encouraging council officers, digital makers, councillors, community activists, hyperlocals, academics and voters of tomorrow to join in. Over the two days of Notwestminster, we’ll run a series of free events including a Maker Day and PechaKucha Night on the Friday, and a Saturday full of workshops, open discussions and more. We are also planning some public events on the theme of local democracy in the same week.
