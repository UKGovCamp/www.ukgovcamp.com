**Applicant:** Lesley Thomson ([@lelil](https://twitter.com/lelil))

**Date & further details:** TBC

**Funding provided:** Â£500

**Purpose:** provide a space for people to talk, listen and think about how communication is changing across the public sector and how people can share and exchange information and make connections that can help change the way things are done.

**Audience:** Scottish comms professionals (will be targeted at those in public sector, but will be open to all).

**Format:** probably consistent with commscamp: mainly unconference, but there may be a limited number of more formal sessions.
