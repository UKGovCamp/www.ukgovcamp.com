UKGovCamp is a brilliant community built around our annual unconference and grant fund.

Us current organisers have been thinking whether there's more we can do.

So we're looking for a small group of people to lead this work.

Whatever they decide, we need to create a legal entity. This need started when we were unable to book venues for the January 2025 event, because UKGovCamp isn't a company.

So if you'd like to research and decide the future of UKGovCamp, please let us know by 23:55 Sunday 13 April 2025 via [organisers@ukgovcamp.com.](mailto:organisers@ukgovcamp.com)

We hope the new group will complete their initial work before the Summer holidays start, ie end of June 2025.
