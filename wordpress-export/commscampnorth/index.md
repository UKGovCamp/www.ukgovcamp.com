- **Applicant:** Dan Slee
- **Funding agree:** £500

**Event details:** After the success of commscamp in Birmingham, the team have decided to push the boat out and run an event in Manchester too. The principles are the same: an event that mixes local and central government as well as NHS people together to see how we can use digital technology to to do a better job. As ever, this is being run on open space and not for profit principles

**Funding will be used for:** This will help to pay for the venue

**About the organiser:** Dan is a former local government officer who's helped run #brewcamp, #hyperwm and #commscamp. He'll be running this event with Emma Rodgers (Stoke-on-Trent City Council), Kate Norman (NHS) and Bridget Aherne (NHS Haelo)
