We’re looking to stage – for the third year – an unconference in the West Midlands that brings together people in and around local government. Previous years have been half day but we’re looking to stage a full day event for the first time. One of the delights of hyperwm is to stage something off the beaten track in a place where they aren’t often held and attracting people who’ve just never been to an unconference before. In the past this has seen events held at Walsall and Warwick. To continue the ‘W’ theme were exploring staging this year’s event in West Bromwich.
