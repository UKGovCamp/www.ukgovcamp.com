NSS Camp have successfully applied to the UKGovCamp grant fund and will receive £1000. Below is their application:

**Name of applicant:** Pauline Roche

**Description of the event:** An unconference for reps from Neighbourhood Network Schemes, Connected Communities and hyperlocal media from Birmingham.

**How much funding are you looking for?** £1,000.

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?** Venue hire and catering.

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:** I am an amplifier, producer, relationship broker and freelance journalist with a Digital Inclusion/Open data portfolio, working for [Digital NNS](https://digitalnns.org.uk/about-digital-nns/) in Birmingham as the Community Lead supporting [Neighbourhood Network Schemes](https://www.bvsc.org/neighbourhood-network-schemes-in-birmingham) (NNSs) to maximise opportunities for digital inclusion in neighbourhoods; I produce and co-present the weekly [Dr Tech Show](http://bit.ly/DrTechShow) with Sweyn Hunter and am a co-organiser of [Open Data Camp](https://www.odcamp.uk) (also funded and supported by UK GovCamp); I have previously run [VCSSCamp](https://vcsscamp.wordpress.com/about-vcsscamp/) and received support for that from UK GovCamp; I believe that introducing the unconference concept to the NNSs, and involving local hyperlocal media, will offer them opportunities to discuss new ideas, network and collaborate for the benefit of assets and citizens they all support; the event will broadly cover transparency, engagement, service delivery and collaboration involving technology
