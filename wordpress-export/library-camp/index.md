Library Camp facilitates the debate in encouraging awareness and use of Libraries, particularly among those who do not use the existing service.

Those involved in the voluntary organisation want to provide a complimentary opinion on local governments’ duty towards libraries. An alternative debate about the present state and future direction of libraries.

The Library Camp unconference in Birmingham, held last year, was to be such a success, a second event felt obligatory. About 175 information professionals (and even some librarians!) attended last years event. We’d like to invite more this year. It appears there is demand for library focused unconferences. In January we hosted a mini camp for 40 attendees in Manchester, which sold out in a day. Our May mini camp held in Leeds sold out with a dozen on a wait list.
