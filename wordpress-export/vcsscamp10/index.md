**Your full name**

Kate White

**Name of your event**

VCSS Camp 10

**Description of the event**

[VCSS Camp](https://twitter.com/VCSSCamp) is an unconference for London's local infrastructure support organisations (CVSs and [Volunteer Centres](https://londonplus.org/councils-for-voluntary-services-volunteer-centres) along with specialist infrastructure orgs e.g. [Inclusion London](https://www.inclusionlondon.org.uk/) & [Young Brent Foundation](https://youngbrentfoundation.org.uk/)) to come together to connect, share and learn how digital, data & tech can help us all support a thriving civil society.

**How much funding do you need?**

Â£500

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?**

To contribute towards room hire and catering. This is the first time we've convened this event (founded by Pauline Roche and colleagues) in person since 2018 and currently have 42 bookings from a range of infrastructure organisations in London. We already have match funding in place from [National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/) (part of thir [Digital Foundations programme](https://superhighways.org.uk/who-we-are/partners-and-programmes/digital-foundations/)) and [London Plus](https://londonplus.org/).

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:**

I've been managing and developing [Superhighways](https://superhighways.org.uk) for over 20 years - supporting small charities and community organisations in London gain essential digital and data skills, backed by the right tech, to achieve their goals.

I'm also a volunteer co-organiser for [TechSoup Connect London](https://events.techsoup.org/techsoup-connect-london-chapter/) a tech for good community, and was one of the founding members of the [UK Tech for Good Network](https://www.techforgoodorganisers.uk/).

In addition I'm a trustee of a local advice, counselling & wellbeing charity. This year's VCSS Camp builds on an online CVS Development Workers Network Superhighways has been convening for circa 18 months. Much has changed since the pandemic, and with continuing cost of living pressures on the sector, we wanted to provide the opportunity for staff from London's local infrastructure organisations to come together in person to have further conversations about how they can better use digital, data & tech - sharing challenges and identifying ideas for new ways of working and collaboration.

We will capture pledges of action, along with support needs for LIOs to realise these changes, co-designing future support for local infrastructure organisations to be as effective as they can be in response.
