LocalGov Digital are again running LocalGovCamp. It’s a two day event but we’re looking for funding for the Saturday unconference – still run on the same model as when Dave Briggs started it in 2009. It will be in Sheffield (at HUBS, Hallam University Student Union) on 12 September 2015 and will be free to all attending (around 150).

Open to anyone working in or around local government and passionate about positive change, usually attracts those working with digital in/with local government to transform local public services. We work at attracting councillors and other local decision makers as well as frontline staff and those from voluntary and wider public sector.

Usual unconference format – no agenda before the day and simultaneous sessions in a number of break-out spaces.
