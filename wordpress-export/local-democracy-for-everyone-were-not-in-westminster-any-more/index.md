Our event is for anyone who has something positive to say about local democracy. We want to bring together local government officers, councillors, digital makers, academics, activists, hyperlocals and voters of the future. Our aim is to work together to create new ideas for doing local democracy. The event will include open discussions, advice about using digital tools and creative activities with a distinctly democratic flavour. Our outline schedule includes lightning talks, open workshops / discussions and companion events including a PechaKucha night. The final session of the day will be an ideas bazaar in which participants will present their ideas and exchange the resources and skills to take them forwards. We have a particular interest in developing some digital democracy prototypes and we want to connect with others who share our aspirations. The event is already attracting interest from politicians, officers, thinkers and makers.
