**Description of the event:** [BASH Festival](https://bashfestival.io/) is a free week-long coding festival for 13-17 year olds [across the UK](https://bashfestival.io/hubs). Teams will spend the week building awesome projects together before travelling to Birmingham for our finale weekend, packed with talks, workshops, music, films and more. Projects will be focused around any of our three themes - games, hardware and data.

**How much funding?** £500

**What will it be used for?** Right now we're still working towards meeting the minimal running costs of the event - so this money will likely go directly on venue hire. However, if we exceed our costs of running the event, we'll create a hardship fund to help young people fund their travel to the regional hub in the week and Birmingham in the weekend.

**Details of the applicant:** \[I'm [Kevin Lewis](https://twitter.com/_phzn) and\] I run [Underland](https://underland.xyz/) - a small team which builds software and runs events for developers. I first got into tech through civic tech events, and want to provide similar opportunities to young people. The same way I was given support from others to build my skills, I want to support technical young people in the next steps after gaining beginner-level knowledge.
