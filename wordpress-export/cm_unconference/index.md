James Arthur Cattell has successfully applied to the UKGovcamp grant fund and will receive £500. Below is their application:

**Name of applicant: James Arthur Cattell** 

**Description of the event:** Community (manager's) unconference

**How much funding are you looking for?** £500

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?** Venue hire and catering. Purpose is to network with fellow attendees and discuss topics relevant to the event. Format will by unconference and you can attend online or in-person. The event's for anyone involved or interested in community building and management.

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:** I'm a serial unconference organiser and community manager. I freelance in both these areas and also jobshare in the UK Civil Service as a delivery manager. My interest in running an unconference for community managers is because this type of event doesn't exist, yet.
