We ran commscamp in 2013 as an unconference for comms and pr people. Three of us ran it – Darren Caveney and Dan Slee from local government and Ann Kempster from central government.

More than 130 came to the Bond Company in Birmingham and we turned the wait list off at 400 so in short this was a success.

We live streamed and posted the sessions up as youtube clips afterwards.

We’d like to do it again because the imperative for closer working with each other is growing as is sharing knowledge and ideas.
