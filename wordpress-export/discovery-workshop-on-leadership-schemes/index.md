**Description of the event**: Our discovery question is "leadership for what?" which is also the theme of our opening talk from Dr. Clare Price-Dowd, Head of Insights, research and evaluation at the NHS Leadership Academy. We'll then break into groups for discussions using either lean coffee or open space technology. A vegan and gluten free lunch will be provided. The afternoon will combine empathy mapping, story boarding and other activities.
