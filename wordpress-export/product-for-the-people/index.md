#### [Grant fund](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/grants/) application:

**Name**: Matt Jukes.

**Your email**: [iam@jukes.ie](mailto:iam@jukes.ie)

**Event**: Product for the People.

**Description**: [Product for the People](https://productforthepeople.xyz/) is a hybrid unconference (we have invited speakers to open before the majority of the day is unconference) for people interested in product management in public service (and we have a broad definition of public service - including government, health, charities, higher education and more). We have already had six events (2 in London + Cardiff, Bristol, Manchester and Leeds) in two years and this year have events scheduled for London (April), Birmingham (June) and Newcastle (TBC).

**Amount requested**: ¬£600.

**What the funding will be used for**: We have some unexpected venue costs this year as well as wanting to provide some snacks and refreshments at events - 2023 we had funding from UK Gov Camp that covered the first 5 events and as organisers we covers the sixth but this year is proving more expensive so far.

**About you, what you do, and your interest in running this event**: The organisers are myself - Matt Jukes (Lead Product Manager for GOVUK), Debbie Blanchard (Head of Product at DfE) and Steve Messer (Strategic Product Lead for MHCLG's Planning Data work). We are all long time community contributors who decided to run this event to fill the gap when the xGov community went quiet but also to broaden it to colleagues who were not able to engage previously. We also wanted to experiment with running a minimal viable unconference - as lightweight as possible, getting to the root of the open space origins.
