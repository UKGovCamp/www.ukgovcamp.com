GovCamp North have successfully applied to the UKGovCamp grant fund and will receive £1000. Below is their application:

**Name of applicant:** Peter Bromley

**Description of the event:** GovCamp North is an attendee lead, open and inclusive space for learning, sharing and testing ideas. GovCamp North is here to connect people who design and deliver public services, creating an inclusive space for reflection, learning and exchange. By being open, fun and free to access, we will help to explore and test ideas, build personal skills and make public services better as part of a community of likeminded people. We recognise the amazing experience provided by UK GovCamp and want to open the experience to more people by having an event run by and held (in future years post-COVID) across the North. We will running this as a virtual event for about 300 people.

**How much funding are you looking for?** £1000

**What do you expect the funding will be used for?**

We were hoping to request a grant for £2000 due to the size and scope of the event we are running. We are holding this event online due to COVID. We were initially looking to hold this event face-to-face as we want to keep some of the elements of a face-to-face conference. We need to secure a platform that will allow up to 300 people to attend and actively participate in the online experience. We are also going to post out a care package to attendees, we want to create a community around the event and part of the funding will be used to cover postage and some of the items in the care package such as stickers, cue cards to use in sessions etc.

**Finally, please tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, and your interest in running this event:** I am Peter Bromley, a Product Manager at Ofsted. I am part of an amazing and dedicated team of people from across the North who want to bring a regular GovCamp experience to the North.
